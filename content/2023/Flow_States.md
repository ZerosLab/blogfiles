| **Dose**      | **Result** | **Success?**|
| -------------: | ------------: |: ------:|
| Approx. 45mg &#124;  |  Successfully induced state of focus. Wrote most of an 800 word essay in one day.|✓|
| 34mg &#124;  |       Arguable success, wrote this entry and got a few hundred words out of a 1000 word paper.| ~ |
| 18mg &#124;| 7 hours after previous test. Success. Finished 1000 word paper. dose is not necessarily correlated with success, as a later yet smaller dose produced more productivity. Had psych class in between doses, likely a factor.|✓|
| 0mg &#124;| testing another method, went to library reading room to attempt mirroring behavior, as comparison to caffination. made some progress, but did not induce focus|x|
| 18mg | testing if previous 18mg dose was independent of 34mg earlier that day. low productivity. that dose was likely influenced by previous. |x|
| 30mg |  |?|
