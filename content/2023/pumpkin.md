Summary: new blogging philosophy, i made pumopkin bread, and i love my fiancee




Hi! so obviously im  back. im going to try to treat this blog better going forward, and post at least *something* every day.

Anyway. im making pumpkin bread rn, with a recipe ill maybe put on my website (if so its linked right here). 

Addititionally, last night i made [fortune-js](https://github.com/ZerosLab/fortune-js). i wouldnt say its done, but its pretty much there, just gotta fuck with some format processing. 

ive also started working on fully remaking wikiquote-fortune, which has been abandoned for some time. im trying to rewrite it using python, but i might shift to a language im less familiar with. 

gonna see my fiancee next week, and really looking forward to it, were planning on some dinner dates, \[REDACTED], and cuddling.

anyway, hope folks are doing well, and im gonna try to stay pretty active on here, as opposed to how ive been in the past lol. 

oh also i might post an update for [The Gospel of Asmodeus](https://archiveofourown.org/works/35611465) soon. that will be a sex scene in a cave. highly heretical lol. 


P.S. also i made an [Etsy shop](ZeroPatches.etsy.com) where i sell patches.
