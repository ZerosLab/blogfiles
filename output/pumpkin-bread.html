    <p>Hi! so obviously im  back. im going to try to treat this blog better going forward, and post at least <em>something</em> every day.</p>
<p>Anyway. im making pumpkin bread rn, with a recipe ill maybe put on my website (if so its linked right here). </p>
<p>Addititionally, last night i made <a href="https://github.com/ZerosLab/fortune-js">fortune-js</a>. i wouldnt say its done, but its pretty much there, just gotta fuck with some format processing. </p>
<p>ive also started working on fully remaking wikiquote-fortune, which has been abandoned for some time. im trying to rewrite it using python, but i might shift to a language im less familiar with. </p>
<p>gonna see my fiancee next week, and really looking forward to it, were planning on some dinner dates, [REDACTED], and cuddling.</p>
<p>anyway, hope folks are doing well, and im gonna try to stay pretty active on here, as opposed to how ive been in the past lol. </p>
<p>oh also i might post an update for <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/35611465">The Gospel of Asmodeus</a> soon. that will be a sex scene in a cave. highly heretical lol. </p>
<p>P.S. also i made an <a href="ZeroPatches.etsy.com">Etsy shop</a> where i sell patches.</p>
